# Atomic Design
Atomic Design is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down user interfaces into their fundamental building blocks. It consists of five distinct levels: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

## Atoms

Atoms include basic HTML tags like buttons, labels, and inputs.

## Molecules

Molecules are combinations of atoms that form more complex components, such as a search bar (input + button) or a card (image + text + button).

## Organisms

Organisms are groups of molecules and atoms that create distinct sections of an interface, like a header (logo + navigation + search bar) or a footer (links + contact info).

## Templates

Templates are page-level structures that define the layout and arrangement of organisms, providing a framework for content placement.

## Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates filled with real content, representing the final user interface that users interact with.
