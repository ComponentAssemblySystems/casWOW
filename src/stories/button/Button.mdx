# Definition

Button is a clickable interactive element that triggers a response.
You can place text and icons inside of a button.
Buttons are often used for form submissions and to toggle elements into view.

## Usage

The component comes in different variants such as `primary`, `secondary`, `large` and `small` which you can use to alter the look and feel of the button.
You can also create outline buttons by setting the adding the class `btn-outline-*` to the button element, where `*` is the variant name.
