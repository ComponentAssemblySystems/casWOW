# Definition

Tables are used to display data in a structured format using rows and columns.

## Usage

The component comes with various styles such as `striped`, `bordered`, and `hover` to enhance the appearance and readability of the table data.
You can also make tables responsive by wrapping them in a container with the class `table-responsive-*`, where `*` is the breakpoint name.
