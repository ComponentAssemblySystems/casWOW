# Definition

The Breadcrumbs component is a navigational aid that helps users understand their current location within a website's hierarchy. It provides a trail of links that represent the path from the homepage to the current page, allowing users to easily navigate back to previous sections.

## Usage

The Breadcrumbs component is typically used at the top of a webpage, just below the header or navigation bar. It displays a series of links separated by a delimiter (usually a slash or greater-than symbol) that indicate the user's current position within the site's structure. Each link in the breadcrumb trail is clickable, allowing users to quickly return to higher-level pages.
