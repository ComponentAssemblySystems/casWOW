# Definition

The Grid component is a layout structure utilizing a 12-column system to organize and align content on the page. There are six responsive levels to create a flexible and consistent design across different screen sizes.

## Usage

The Grid component is used to create structured layouts by dividing the page into a series of rows and columns. This allows for precise placement of content, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design. The grid system supports responsive design, adapting to various screen sizes for optimal user experience.

## Default implementation

The default Grid is wrapped in the class `container-fluid`, which adjusts to the screen size, filling the available space of the parent wrapper. By default, the grid adjusts as the screen size changes, with each column taking up equal space.

## Additional variations

To change the grid layout, update grid class to include either the breakpoint size with the individual width amount or just with an individual width amount (e.g. `col-md-6` or `col-6`).
