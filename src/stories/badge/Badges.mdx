# Definition

Badges are used to add additional information to any content. They can be used to highlight new or unread items, or to indicate the status of an item.

## Usage

By default, badges are styled with a background color and white text. To increase contrast, light background utilize dark text. Badges in CASim are all rounded (pill) by default.

Badges can be used in a variety of ways, including:
- As a count or label for items, such as notifications or messages.
- To indicate the status of an item, such as "New" or "Updated".
- To highlight a user's role, such as "Admin" or "Project Manager".
- To show progress or completion, such as "In Progress" or "Completed".
- To provide additional context or information, such as "Beta" or "Deprecated".
- To draw attention to important information, such as "Urgent" or "Important".

Badge positioning can vary based on the context in which they are used. Common positions include:
- Top-right corner of an icon or button.
- Inline with text or other content.
- Within a list item or card.

## Badge as a Counter

As this example shows, badges can be used as counters to indicate the number of unread messages or notifications. This is typically done by positioning the badge in the top-right corner of an icon or button.

```html
<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary position-relative">
  Inbox
  <span class="position-absolute top-0 start-100 translate-middle badge rounded-pill bg-danger">
    99+
    <span class="visually-hidden">unread messages</span>
  </span>
</button>
```
