# Definition

The Alert component is used to display important messages to users, such as warnings, information, or confirmations. Alerts can be styled in various ways to indicate the nature of the message, such as primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, and dark.

## Usage

The Alert component can be used to grab the user's attention for critical information or feedback. It can be displayed in different styles to convey the urgency or type of message. Alerts can also be configured to be inline or block-level elements, depending on the layout requirements.

## Additional variations

### Inline Alerts

Inline alerts are designed to be used within the flow of text or other content, providing contextual feedback without disrupting the layout. The border is removed, and the alert blends seamlessly with surrounding elements.

Inline alerts are created by adding the `inline` class to the Alert component.

Inline alerts can not be dismissed.
