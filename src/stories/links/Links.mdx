# Definition

Links (or anchors) are used to navigate between pages or to different sections within a page.

## Usage

Links can be styled in different ways using classes such as `<a class="fw-bold">` for heavy links and `<a class="icon-link">` for links with icons. These can be combined to have heavy links with icons `<a class="fw-bold icon-link">`.
